Notes to anyone picking this up:
 - Setting the policy to change the roles on the service account fails. I think
   this needs to be set on the project not the service account, but that means
   grabbing the entirety of the bindings for the project, finding the service account,
   adding the role, then settings the entirety of the roles to the new set.
 - You can't add oslogin ssh keys to a service account (or any account) without being
   authed as that account. That means that you would need to reauth in the middle of
   the test
     - as a workaround there is a directory api that might make this easier, haven't
       done a lot of digging into it
